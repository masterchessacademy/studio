- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA), a slightly desaturated and bright background providing a contrast to the board without being harsh.  
- Accent color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC), for highlights and interactive elements, providing visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral look that's easy to read.
- Use simple, minimalist icons for any interactive elements.
- Center the chessboard and controls on the page for a clean, focused user experience.
